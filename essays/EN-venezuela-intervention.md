# Intervention in Venezuela: The Framework of Incompatibility of Presences between the U.S. and Russia

The intervention in Venezuela is pressure on Russia and other governments with which the U.S. has conflicts. Russia is a direct observer of every international action by its friends and enemies. None of the actors involved in these recent events ignores this, therefore, it is interpreted as **intentional pressure** toward the enemies of the U.S., primarily toward Russia.

The U.S. and Russia have a very complicated relationship with historical ups and downs, and therefore, this cannot be interpreted as a discussion whose starting point was Putin bombing Kyiv four years ago. It is necessary to go back to the Cold War, a scenario in which the Soviet Union was dissolving, tensions between the U.S. and Russia were dilating, but post-tsarist and pro-Soviet factors were reemerging, particularly in the person and power of Vladimir Putin. The two powers do not have ideological or personal incompatibilities, not even managerial ones (differences yes). They have **incompatibilities of presence**. Hegemony becomes uneasy with the existence of multiple leaders and even worse with two polarized centers of power, mainly due to historical experience. Within this framework, the U.S. prioritizes risks and threats, uses a combination of military and diplomatic mechanisms to exercise and sustain its hegemony (or its hegemonic pretensions).

That is why it is hegemonic and it is what many times a sovereign power that tends toward hegemony seeks: a certain capacity to impose itself and repel risks to its existence, stability, and security (at least potentially). Hegemony *is not the whim of a country*, it is not a policy established by a colonizer in an office, it is an **effective capacity** of certain powers that make them so: hegemonic.

The U.S. will tend toward the conservation of the *status quo* regarding its hegemonic pretension. This is seen in the fact that bipartisanship, even where its differences are most marked, shows no radically different foreign policy. The concept of hegemony is mainly related to **resources** and **universal police control**. For its part, Russia pursues a **historical-cultural hegemony**. For them, hegemony is interpreted as the capacity to define the limits of their own post-Soviet territory, which has cultural belonging and tends toward historical imperialism. They also seek to counteract the hegemonic pretensions of American power and be capable of establishing at will their military capacity to execute the imposition of their hegemonic vision.

Concretely, there exists an **incompatibility of hegemonic presences** defined by their interpretation of hegemony and by the overlap of effective power regarding the interpretative differences of the hegemonic. In other words, **the U.S. and Russia exist in a state of involuntary, permanent, and inevitable conflict** because their areas of effective power are sometimes overlapping.

Within this framework, today's intervention has a **very high symbolic value**, which makes it unequivocally understood that these are actions directed toward Russia within the framework of this conflict and, in a more recent power relationship, toward China and Iran.

The Trump administration (with its foreign policy advisors) understands that the intervention was necessary to reinforce the message that in the world there is an Executive Power that is not in the UN Security Council, nor in Geneva, nor in Vienna, nor in The Hague; it is at **1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington D.C.**, where the President of the U.S. eats, sleeps, and signs.

## Is Everything Indirect and Related to Russia?

**No.** The American intervention is additionally motivated by:

- The **sustenance of its international hegemony**, using contextual factors such as the erosion of international norms (in disuse, normalized non-compliance, etc.)
- The need to **reinforce its legal system** and its external validity (enforcing existing sentences against the Venezuelan president)
- **Reinforcing the Trump administration domestically**, since in terms of domestic politics this unites flags before a common action and redirects pressures toward other management problems seen as more "urgent" or "important" (the scale of priorities rises and attention concentrates on this act, other problems remain, but one priority lower)
- **Economic and energy reasons**, because although the U.S. does not depend on Venezuelan oil per se, does not strictly need the product, it does need to maintain control and send signals that it can control both the supply and price of fuels in its country
- The **reinforcement of deterrence**, demonstrating that unilaterally imposed sanctions can also be enforced unilaterally, even breaking international pacts and the maximum quality of international power: *sovereignty*

## Conclusion

Therefore, one can say that within this framework, the intervention in Venezuela is linked to a relationship of powers in conflict that is *prior* and of *greater magnitude* than the intervention itself. It cannot be analyzed or interpreted outside of the historical geopolitics that contains it. This being so, **Venezuela does not define the conflict between powers, but it does make it visible**.
